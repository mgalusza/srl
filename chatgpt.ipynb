During flight, the temperature of the fuel in the tanks decreases, due to the low temperatures in the upper atmosphere. This causes precipitation of the dissolved water from the fuel. The separated water then drops to the bottom of the tank, because it is denser than the fuel. Since the water is no longer in solution, it can form droplets which can supercool to below 0 째C (32 째F). If these supercooled droplets collide with a surface they can freeze and may result in blocked fuel inlet pipes.[19] This was the cause of the British Airways Flight 38 accident. Removing all water from fuel is impractical; therefore, fuel heaters are usually used on commercial aircraft to prevent water in fuel from freezing. There are several methods for detecting water in jet fuel. A visual check may detect high concentrations of suspended water, as this will cause the fuel to become hazy in appearance. An industry standard chemical test for the detection of free water in jet fuel uses a water-sensitive filter pad that turns green if the fuel exceeds the specification limit of 30 ppm (parts per million) free water.[20] A critical test to rate the ability of jet fuel to release emulsified water when passed through coalescing filters is ASTM standard D3948 Standard Test Method for Determining Water Separation Characteristics of Aviation Turbine Fuels by Portable Separometer.\"\u001b[0m \u001b[0mdecide\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0mspark\u001b[0m  \u001b[0mhas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mimpact\u001b[0m \u001b[0mon\u001b[0m \u001b[0mfuel\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m \u001b[0mAnswer\u001b[0m \u001b[0myes\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mor\u001b[0m \u001b[0mno\u001b[0m \u001b[0monly\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \"\"\"\n\u001b[0;32m----> 4\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mresponse\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mchat_with_gpt\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"User: \"\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m+\u001b[0m \u001b[0mt\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"AI:\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0mresponse\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      6\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mif\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\"yes\"\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32min\u001b[0m \u001b[0mresponse\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n",
